# Publishing to NPM

### New automated way

- Open `package.json`, up the version number
- Make sure nothing else is changed in the working tree
- Run `npm run release`

### Manual OLD way

I'll mostly be doing this manually, but I keep forgetting the steps.

- Make sure you're logged in using `npm login`
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` file
- Change version numbers in the following files
  - `scss/_main.css`
  - `package.json`
- Make sure to build css files again `npm run scss` so that they have the updated version numbers
- Publish `npm publish`
- `git tag -a $VERSION -m "Release $VERSION"`
- `git push --tags`
